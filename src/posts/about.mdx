# About Me and This Project

Hello! I'm the developer behind this resume builder application. I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and explain what this project is all about.

## My Background

I'm a passionate web developer with experience in building modern, interactive web applications. My journey in tech started several years ago when I first discovered the joy of creating something from nothing but code.

My areas of expertise include:

- Frontend development with React and Next.js
- Building responsive and accessible user interfaces
- JavaScript/TypeScript development
- Modern CSS techniques and frameworks
- Full-stack development
