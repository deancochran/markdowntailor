## The Challenge with Traditional Resume Building

For years, professionals have been locked into clunky word processors that make version control a nightmare. Saving endless `resume_final_v2_updated.docx` files is a familiar pain point for many. These tools lack the flexibility needed to quickly adapt a resume for different roles, often leading to formatting inconsistencies and wasted time that could be better spent on job-searching.

### The Common Frustrations:

* **Version Control Chaos** - *Where is that latest version?*
* **Formatting Nightmares** - *Why did my bullet points suddenly change?*
* **Time-Consuming Edits** - *Hours spent on layout instead of content*
* **Inconsistent Design** - *Different fonts and spacing across versions*

```javascript
// The traditional resume workflow
function traditionalResumeWorkflow() {
  let hours = 0;
  while (!perfectFormat) {
    editContent();
    fixBrokenFormatting(); // This always breaks something else
    saveNewVersion();      // resume_final_FINAL_v3_reallyFinal.docx
    hours++;
  }
  return frustration * hours;
}
```

> **Your time is valuable**. Every minute spent fighting with formatting is a minute not spent on perfecting your professional narrative or preparing for interviews.
