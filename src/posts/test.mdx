# Testing MDX Features

This post demonstrates the various features and components available in our MDX-powered blog system.

## Basic Markdown

Let's start with basic markdown features:

### Text Formatting

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, or ***bold and italic*** text.

### Lists

Unordered list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Ordered list:
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote.
> It can span multiple lines.

### Code

Inline code: `const greeting = "Hello, world!";`

Code block:
```javascript
function calculateTotal(items) {
  return items.reduce((total, item) => {
    return total + item.price;
  }, 0);
}
```

## Custom Components

Our MDX setup includes some custom components:

### Callouts

<Callout type="info">
  This is an informational callout that provides helpful context.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
  This is a warning callout that highlights potential issues.
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
  This is an error callout that indicates something critical.
</Callout>

<Callout type="success">
  This is a success callout that celebrates achievements.
</Callout>

### Images

Images are rendered using Next.js Image component for optimization:
