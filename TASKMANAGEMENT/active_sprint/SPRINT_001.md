## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **IaC Complexity**: Terraform configuration errors
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing in staging environment
   - *Fallback*: Manual deployment procedures documented

2. **AI Cost Overruns**: Usage spike beyond budget
   - *Mitigation*: Aggressive rate limiting and monitoring
   - *Fallback*: Automatic service suspension

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: alpha exposure risks
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive security testing
   - *Fallback*: Rapid response team and rollback procedures
