# Sprint 001 - Beta Launch Preparation

## Executive Summary
This sprint focuses on delivering a secure, stable beta version of ResumeForge with enterprise-grade infrastructure, locked-down AI usage controls, and comprehensive documentation. All critical systems must be bulletproof for the July 1st beta launch.


## Definitions of Done (Non-Negotiable Primary Objectives)

### Flawless Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
**Zero-downtime deployment capability with automated rollback**
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployment capability with automated rollback
- [ ] Terraform configurations tested and validated
- [ ] All environments provisioned and accessible
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures verified
- [ ] Security scans passed
- [ ] Cost optimization implemented
- [ ] Terraform deploys identical environments (dev/staging/prod) in <10 minutes
- [ ] Infrastructure passes all security scans (CIS benchmarks)
- [ ] Automated disaster recovery tested and documented
- [ ] State management with encryption and versioning
- [ ] Cost optimization alerts configured (<$500/month beta budget)

### AI Usage Limits - Complete Lockdown
**Bulletproof AI usage controls with real-time monitoring**
- [ ] Hard limit: $5.00 per user maximum (no exceptions)

- [ ] Circuit breaker: Auto-disable AI if 80% of monthly budget consumed
- [ ] Real-time usage dashboard with alerts
- [ ] Malicious prompt detection and blocking (99.9% accuracy)
- [ ] Comprehensive audit logging for all AI interactions

### User Data Autonamy
**Enable Users to have complete control of there data**
- [ ] User Deletion with Cascades
- [ ] Process tested with playwright/vitest

### README.md Complete Overhaul
**Professional, comprehensive documentation for beta launch**
- [ ] Beta-specific setup instructions
- [ ] Infrastructure deployment guide
- [ ] AI usage monitoring documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting section with common issues
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and SLA commitments
- [ ] Security and compliance information

### Sprint 002 Planning & Roadmap
**Detailed post-beta sprint planning with user feedback integration**
- [ ] Sprint 002 backlog prioritized and estimated
- [ ] User feedback collection strategy defined
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization plan
- [ ] Feature enhancement roadmap (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Technical debt reduction plan

## Technical Specifications

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Hosting**: AWS/Vercel with auto-scaling
- **Database**: Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **CDN**: CloudFront for global delivery
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and alerting
- **Backup**: Automated daily backups with 30-day retention

### AI Usage Control Specifications
```yaml
ai_limits:
  per_user_budget: $5.00
  rate_limits:
    per_minute: 10
    per_hour: 100
    per_day: 500
  circuit_breaker:
    threshold: 80% of monthly budget
    recovery_time: 24 hours
  monitoring:
    real_time_cost_tracking: true
    usage_alerts: true
    audit_logging: comprehensive
```

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Page Load Time**: <2 seconds (95th percentile)
- **API Response Time**: <500ms average
- **Database Query Time**: <100ms average
- **Uptime SLA**: 99.9% during beta period

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk Items
1. **IaC Complexity**: Terraform configuration errors
   - *Mitigation*: Extensive testing in staging environment
   - *Fallback*: Manual deployment procedures documented

2. **AI Cost Overruns**: Usage spike beyond budget
   - *Mitigation*: Aggressive rate limiting and monitoring
   - *Fallback*: Automatic service suspension

3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Beta exposure risks
   - *Mitigation*: Comprehensive security testing
   - *Fallback*: Rapid response team and rollback procedures
